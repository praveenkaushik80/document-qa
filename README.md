This readme describes a system for question answering over a uploaded PDF document using Groq's API and Streamlit.

### Prerequisites
1. Groq API Key: You will need a Groq API key to access their Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Functionality
1. Input Groq API Key: The system will prompt you to enter your Groq API key securely.
2. Upload PDF Document: You can upload a PDF document for which you want to answer questions.
3. Document Vectorization: The system will process the uploaded PDF and convert it into a vector representation suitable for Groq's LLMs (details on the vectorization process can be added here).
4. Question Answering: You can then ask questions related to the document. The system will use Groq's API and your chosen LLM model to answer your questions based on the document content.
